Notes:

# How is Chronic Kidney Disease diagnosed? 
Source - https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354527
- Blood tests. 
    - Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood.
- Urine tests. 
    - Analyzing a sample of your urine can reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease.
- Imaging tests. 
    - Your doctor might use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests might be used in some cases.
- Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing

# diabetes - secondary cause
# hypertension (high blood pressure) - 2nd most common cause 
# coronary - pump blood to heart so if there is junk that can cause heart disease or cardiac arrest
# ckd - end stage renal disease (kidney not functioning need dialysis)

 How is anemia diagnosed? 
- For anemia, your doctor will likely be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in your blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in your blood.

 Serum Creatinine (creatin-neen)
- a 30% decrease in serum creatinine is a sign of ckd. Previous level would need to be known to determine this.

 Sodium - elevated blood pressure (BP) is a frequent finding and is traditionally considered a direct consequence of their sodium sensitivity. Indeed, sodium and fluid retention, causing hypervolemia, leads to the development of hypertension in CKD 

 Potassium - When kidneys fail they can no longer remove excess potassium, so the level builds up in the body. High potassium in the blood is called hyperkalemia, which may occur in people with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD)

 Packed Cell Volume - Majority of patients with PCV <30% were in Stage 4 or 5 renal disease. The findings were statistically significant (P = 0.001) 

 Albuminuria is a sign of kidney disease and means that you have too much albumin in your urine 
- Al = normal, abnormal
- Abnormal amount of protein created by liver in urine
- Can also be a sign of dehydration


 Pedal Edema = swelling of the legs
- this occurs when most of your kidneys have been destroyed which would mean you have late stage renal disease

 Periorbital Edema
- swelling around your eyes

 WBC
- In conclusion, elevated WBC count served as a predictor of the odds of kidney function decline in this population, which supports the hypothesis that systemic inflammation may serve as a risk factor for CKD development. 

 RBC 
- Low EPO levels cause your red blood cell count to drop and anemia to develop. Most people with kidney disease will develop anemia 


 Appetite
- The progressive decline of glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease patients is associated with a significant reduction in food intake. Approximately one third of chronic dialysis patients complain of a fair or poor appetite and this is related directly to poor patient outcomes 

 Heart Disease
- If you have kidney disease, you are more likely to get heart disease. Heart disease is the most common cause of death among people who have kidney disease. 

 Age
- CKD is more common in people aged 65 years or older (38%) than in people aged 45–64 years (12%) or 18–44 years (6%).
